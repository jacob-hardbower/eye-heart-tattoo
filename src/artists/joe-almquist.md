  Joe has been tattooing since 2007. He has spent most of his career working in
  shops in eastern North Carolina and traveling the east coast working
  conventions and guest spots. Joe specializes in American and Japanese
  traditional designs in both one shot and large scale form.


  ***BOOKS OPEN*** 

  please read below for booking info.


  Thank you for your interest in my work! I am currently only booking 60 days out at a time. If you don't see anything available at this time, just keep checking back. My books are remaining open. However, demand for my work has exceeded my availability and I am now being more selective of the projects I take on. Once you have submitted a request you should hear from me within 48 hours if I will be taking on your tattoo. If I don't feel like I am a good fit, I will do my best to recommend another artist.


  My rate is $225/hour for new clients and I do have a $250 minimum. I also require a $100 deposit. Once I have accepted your request I will send instructions on how to send your deposit. Deposits are non-refundable but they will go towards the final tattoo price.


  I am looking to do more large scale and one point Japanese, American traditional designs like eagles, big cats and girl heads, and pet portraits.


  I will not be reworking or finishing other artist work.


  First sessions for sleeves (half, 3/4, full, and leg), back pieces, chest, and full torso will require a full day session. I am currently only offering full days on Fridays.


  I am very appreciative of everyone who likes my work enough to want to be tattooed by me! Thank you for your support and patience!
