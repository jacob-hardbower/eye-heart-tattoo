bio: >-
  Gabi is a Georgia-born, Colombian-Italian peach who travels up & down the east
  coast to serve her community and create cute tats. She is currently based in
  Raleigh, NC :)

  â€‹

  She has been tattooing since 2019, and has a background in oil painting, art history, and illustration. When she's not tattooing, you can usually find her outside enjoying nature, playing video games, or hanging with her cat babies Bigby & Gustavo.
   
  Lastly, she firmly believes tattooing is a magical, empowering act that must be done with the utmost love and respect.
